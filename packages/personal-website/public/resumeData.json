        "description": "At Maryland I originally intended to graduate with just a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering. Shortly after I started Electrical Engineering, I decided to pick up a minor in Computer Science as well, as the majority of engineering jobs that I saw or heard about required coding skills. Then, at the beginning of my senior year, while taking my first Algorithms course, I realized that my real passion was in Computer Science. So, I turned computer science into a second major and took a little of bit extra time to get both degrees."
